                <h2>Our History</h2>
                <p><img src="images/edkathy.JPG" class="own">
                    Hank and Arlene Clauson eloped from a football game at just 16 years old. After camping at Priest Lake in their early years and doing odd jobs, a special piece of property came up for sale. Hank was a smart man and did whatever it took to create Hanksville.With the help of some dear friends, he turned this land into his own little community.</p>

                <p>With the passing of Hank and Arlene, the property now belongs to their kids, Kathy and Ed (pictured right). They have 3 kids who bring their own families up to the lake frequently. Kathy's son, Jamie, is the maintainance man and keeps everything running smoothly. </p>

                <p>Last year, 2020, was the first year that we opened it up for rent during the months of June, July and August. We look forward to seeing you at the lake!
