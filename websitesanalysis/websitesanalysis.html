    <h1> Websites Assignment</h1><br>

    <p>I chose to do my website analysis on clothing websites because I am not a huge online shopper, and it is attributed to the inability to try on clothes, but mostly the website! If a website is not user friendly, I get bored with it and move on. <br>


        <p>The website I like the most is <a href="https://sovereignboutique.com">Shop Sovereign Boutique</a>. My babysitter and neighbor from my childood runs this new clothing store. This website actually just launched about a week ago, so of course I had to check it out. The first thing I looked at was if it worked with mobile, and it did. What really stuck out to me was her pictures and color scheme. The colors are soft, and go well together. What I love about it is that it has just enough information but not too much, so it is very clean and sleek. Her background is all white which is very clean. Her pictures are a good size, and the home page even has rounded arch shape pictures that really adds to the style of the website. It is very pleasing to the eye. The only thing I really don't like is that the text in the footer is not centered. That is a big pet peeve of mine. Other than that, it is very easy to find what you're looking for, and has simple forms you can fill out to get updates or contact the owner. This site feels like more of a relationship between you and the owner, and it made me want to actually buy something online! The code is modern and fairly clean. They use lots of divs, classes, and spans. The content is laid out in columns with a menu, then 3 pictures in a row. Anything more would be overwhelming. It is pretty easy to navigate, except I would like a 'back to shirts' button or whatever you were looking at from something you clicked on. It has features to share on social media which is valuable to the website. As I touched on earlier, the colors are awesome. They put out a confident, modern, welcoming feel, like the clothes will make you feel at ease. I know the owner's mission is to make women feel good about themselves, and the website really plays to this. Like I said, she has a number of buttons where you can track your product, or tweet about it for example. I think this website is my favorite because it is firing on all cylinders. It has amazing eye appeal, has interactive forms, beautiful layout, and it's own style that I have never seen. </p>


        <p> Another website that I like is <a href="https://francescas.com">Francescas.</a> This is a bigger clothing store, but it still has that small town boutique feel. I was disappointed to see that their website opened up to a bunch of deals and bright colors everywhere. That is not what their store looks like in real life. They do still have the clean, sleek feel though with the white background and small logo. One thing I like is the easy navigation items and the side menu. It is more interactive than Shop Sovereign's where it has color options and detatils about the type of clothing you are searching for. As far as code goes, it is cleaner and modern. They use HTML 5 elements, but I did not see a table used. This website is laid out much like the first with a side menu and 3 pictures shown at a time. I would say that it is fairly easy to navigate. This website has a lot of hover features, so it's easy to click on something you didn't mean to click on, and I prefer small amounts of information showing when you hover, but this website has so much. I think less is more in this regard. I think they could improve on colors because they use white and a sort of magenta/purple color here and there. I think using more of a theme would tie things together and set them apart from other clothing websites. I feel like they are traying to expand their store to more of the typical retail line now, rather than the boutique feel they had in the past. If that is their goal, great, but I liked the feel that it had, and I think that would set them apart more. Overall, it's a great website with lots of organized content that is easy to navigate.

            <p>My terrible website is <a href="https://cottonwoodcreekclothing.com">Cottonwood Creek Boutique.</a> This is unfortunate because I also know of the owners, and it is their small business in a small town. They have great items, but I will tell you why they need some help. First of all, the heading area does not have enough to it. It has a nice logo, but it sometimes gets cut off when you change the size of the page. Then, there is no traditional navigation bar. They do have pictures that act as this, but I don't think it's as effective because you have to scroll for what to look for, rather than see all the options up front. They do have a little three lined menu icon, but all the information in that should be displayed in my opinion. When you pick something to shop for like jackets or something, it shows them in rows of tiny pictures! It's like I had to strain my eyes to look at a product. This is the most ridiculous part of the website for me. They put six pictures in a row, where the other websites did three. These photes are also square and the product is lost in the picture. I couldn't order anything from here without seeing it in the store first. The pictures are easier to see in mobile mode, which is important, but photo size on the website is the first thing I'd fix. A few layout tweaks and the website would be way more effective. The code seems to be faily clean and it is modern. I have already touched on navigation, but additionally when you actually click on an item, the page looks nice, except the logo goes away from the top. This is a huge downside for me as well. I do like how simple the website feels, but there is no color scheme. The only colors used are brown and light green in the logo and a background color in the footer. I think using actual colors elsewhere would really bring this site together! It makes me feel like something is missing in the website. I realized that it is missing color. Their product line definitely has a specific style that can be enhanced by an intentional color scheme. One small thing I did really like was the way they set up the footer. It was unique. It has contact information and hours right up front so you aren't searching for it, and then the return policy and social media icons. Granted they didn't have any navigation in here, it looks nice. With a few changes, I think this site could definitely be a favorite of mine!
