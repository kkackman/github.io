        <p>After weighing the options, I would choose justhost.com. Although bluehost.com had the most appealing and straightforward website, I feel like I would be just as happy choosing justhost.com. It seems like a simple process with a variety of plans that readily tell you all the features. It is also a cheaper option considering and comparing the plans from the other sites. </p>
